## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to use basic markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer
 - As a developer, I want to receive and use the user's name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.
 - As a developer, I want to use a simple online tool to share my code, so that I can get all the points!

## Technical Requirements
