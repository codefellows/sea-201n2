# Assignment for Class
Complete the initial setup and scaffolding for this project using your standard practices for creating a new project & repository.

**IN-CLASS WORKSHOP: Write User Stories for Assignment**

In this assignment, on page load, you will be displaying three random images to the DOM from your stock photo assets. Your user will select/click one image from the set of three. On click, the image will log an incremental vote, and then the page will load three new random images.

## User Stories (MVP)
**USER**
- As a user, I want to vote on 3 interesting images quickly and easily, without any repetitions.
- As a user, I want instruction on what action to take, so I know what to do.
- As a user, I want the site to be simple and easy to use, so that I enjoy my voting experience.
- As a user, I want the site to be responsive so that I do not need to scroll to see all three options.
- As a user, I want to see the results of my survey in a list or table format, so I can know which ones were my favorite.
- As a user, I want visual feedback on my choices, so that I know my actions are being logged.
- As a user, I don't want to spend too long on the survey. A progress bar would be helpful.

**DEVELOPER**
- As a developer, I want images sized appropriately so that all the pictures are uniformly scaled.
- As a developer, I want all 3 images displayed to be different so that my user always has 3 random options.
- As a developer, I want to track and store votes so that I can collect and analyze votes.
- As a developer, I want to smoothly render data to DOM with minimal errors.
- As a developer, I want to keep my code minimal, so that I don't run into errors.
- As a developer, I want to provide clear instructions on my page so that the user knows what to do.
- As a developer, I want to use a clean, legible design so that my users don’t get pissed off

**MARKETER**
- As a marketer, I want to display voting data to the user after 15 votes so the user can see the voting outcome.
- As a marketer, I want the user to be prompted to vote 15 times before stopping the survey and displaying the results so that the user doesn’t get tired of the exercise.


## Technical Requirements
 - New GitHub repo set up, and working on a feature branch
 - Project scaffolding complete, with proper file and folder structure
 - Images have been properly sized for project
 - Object constructor implemented and used properly for creating objects
 - Object literal implemented and used properly for managing the functionality of the app; proper use of methods and properties

## User Stories (Stretch)
- (Is this attainable?) As a user, I want to be entertained while on this bus ride.
- As a user, I want helper text to give context to a picture, so that I can select it (accessibility).
- As a user, I'd like to be rewarded for my input.
- As a developer, I want the page layout to respond to different device formats.
- As a developer, I want to ensure that the user sees all of the objects displayed at least one time so that no objects are left out of the voting.
- As a developer, I want to sort the list by number of votes received before displaying it, so that the user can easily see their results.
- As a marketer, I want to calculate the percentage of votes-per-appearances for each photo and display that in a separate list.
- As a marketer, I want to come up with another analysis metric based on the number of clicks, and present all of these data points in a table rather than a list.
